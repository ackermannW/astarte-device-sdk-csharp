# C# Astarte Device SDK
The Astarte Device SDK for C# is a ready-to-use library that provides communication and pairing 
primitives to an [Astarte Cluster](https://github.com/astarte-platform/astarte).

The SDK simplifies all the low-level operations like credentials generation, pairing, local storage,
device registration and exposes a high-level API to enable device data publication and reception.

For an example showing how to send data look [here](/AstarteDeviceSDKExample/README.md).

## Requirements
